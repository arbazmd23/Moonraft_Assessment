#  Challenging Fake Image Detection using GAN Models

This project aims to develop a robust fake image detection system that can differentiate between genuine and manipulated images generated by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). With the proliferation of GAN models, detecting fake or manipulated images has become a challenging task. Our solution employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify and classify fake images, contributing to the fight against digital deception.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop a fake image detection system capable of distinguishing between real and AI-generated images. We aim to achieve high accuracy and robustness in our detection model.


## Dataset

To train and evaluate our fake image detection model, we used a diverse dataset consisting of real and fake images. The dataset is not included in this repository due to its size, but you can obtain it from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ciplab/real-and-fake-face-detection].


## Methodology

Our approach involves training a CNN-based image classifier on the provided dataset. The model learns to differentiate between real and fake images based on their visual features. We employ techniques such as data augmentation and transfer learning to enhance model performanc
